## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Ronin, from SGStudios. I work in AV and am inspired by science fiction, the future of game development and artificial intelligence. 


The "Ronin" moniker comes from a series of inspirations including, but not limited to; Japanese Culture and Ancient Feudal Japan, The Ronin from the Star Wars Visions Universe, The Shogun miniseries, Akiro Kurasawa etc..

SGStudios or Sounds Good Studios is my undeveloped development studio. SGS focuses on high quality audio experiences for video game and cinematic environments. For more see [SGStudios](SGStudios.md)
