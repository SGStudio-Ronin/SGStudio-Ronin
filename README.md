## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Ronin, from SGStudios. I work in AV and am inspired by science fiction, the future of game development and artificial intelligence.

The "Ronin" moniker comes from a series of inspirations including, but not limited to; Japanese Culture and Ancient Feudal Japan, The Ronin from the Star Wars Visions Universe, The Shogun miniseries, Akiro Kurasawa etc..
