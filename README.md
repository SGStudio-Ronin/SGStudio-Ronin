## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am Ronin[^1], from SGStudios[^2]. I work in AV and am inspired by science fiction, the future of game development and artificial intelligence. 


[^1] "Ronin" moniker comes from a series of inspirations including, but not limited to; Japanese Culture and Ancient Feudal Japan, The Ronin from the Star Wars Visions Universe, The Shogun miniseries, Akiro Kurasawa etc..

[^2] SGStudios or Sounds Good Studios is my undeveloped development studio. SGS focuses on high quality audio experiences for video game and cinematic environments. For more see [SGStudios](SGStudios.md)
