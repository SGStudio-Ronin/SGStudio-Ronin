I have a number of ongoing concepts and projects. Mostly game development and music production based. 
I aim to develop a Star Wars RPG based on The Ronin, by Emma Mieko Candon. The goal is TPP, open world, story driven, combat focused, lightsaber weilding game. Themes focusing on the cultural elements of the Japanese world pulled into the Star Wars universe; warring feudal japanese empires, samurai honour and ronin dissonance, jedi and sith (but not the same) and so on. 

Another project is my ongoing music production under the mantle of "***Brady***". I aim to create deep soundscapes and ambiences. I have also focused on production of hip hop and various other electronic genres in the past. Its one of my many missions to learn an audio engine, such as WWise or FMod, to make myself useful in that area of the industry.

Personally I work in AV and I am inspired by science fiction, the future of game development and artificial intelligence.

## Notes

The "Ronin" moniker comes from a series of inspirations including, but not limited to; Japanese Culture and Ancient Feudal Japan, The Ronin from the Star Wars Visions Universe, The Shogun miniseries, Akiro Kurasawa etc..

SGStudios or Sounds Good Studios is my undeveloped development studio. SGS focuses on high quality audio experiences for video game and cinematic environments. For more see [SGStudios](SGStudios.md)
